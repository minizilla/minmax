# Conway Game Of Life

Initially, there is a grid with some cells which may be alive or dead.
Our task is to generate the next generation of cells based on the following rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
