# Minimum initial points to reach destination

Given a M*N grid with each cell consisting of positive, negative, or no points i.e., zero points.
From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1) and we can move to a cell only if we have positive points ( > 0 ) when we move to that cell.
Whenever we pass through a cell, points in that cell are added to our overall points.
We need to find minimum initial points to reach cell (m-1, n-1) from (0, 0).
